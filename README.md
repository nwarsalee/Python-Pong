# Wars-Pong
A remake of the classic game 'pong' on python using the SimpleGraphics module.

### How to Run
* Download the wars-pong.py file and the SimpleGraphics.py file
* Use a command line like Powershell, cmd or terminal and go to the directory of the two files
* Type 'python wars-pong.py'
* Enjoy super stuttery and glitchy pong!

### Disclaimer
I did not make SimpleGraphics, someone else did. So credit to them.
